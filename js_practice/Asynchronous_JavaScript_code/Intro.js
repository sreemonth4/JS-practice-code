// Asynchronous code in JavaScript means that some tasks can run in the background without blocking the main thread. 
// For example, you can use setTimeout to delay a function for a certain time. Synchronous code means that each task has to wait for the previous one to finish before it can start.
//  For example, you can use console.log to print a message immediately. Asynchronous code is useful for handling long tasks, while synchronous code is easier to write and understand.
